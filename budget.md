# Creating Cost Budgets (Billing Alarms) in AWS

AWS allows you to create cost budgets to track and manage your AWS spending. Cost budgets help you set spending limits and receive alerts when your actual costs or usage exceed the defined thresholds. These alerts, also known as billing alarms, help you stay within your budget and avoid unexpected charges.

## Features

### Budgets
- Cost budgets allow you to set monthly, quarterly, or annual spending limits for your AWS account.
- You can create multiple budgets to track spending for different services, projects, or teams within your organization.

### Thresholds
- Cost budgets support both cost and usage thresholds, allowing you to monitor spending based on your preferred metrics.
- You can set specific thresholds for each budget to trigger alerts when actual costs or usage exceed the defined limits.

### Notifications
- When your spending exceeds the defined thresholds, AWS sends notifications to alert you about the budget deviations.
- Notifications can be delivered via email, Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS), or AWS Personal Health Dashboard.

### Forecasting
- Cost budgets provide forecasting capabilities to estimate your future spending based on historical data and current usage trends.
- You can use the forecasted spending to adjust your budgets and allocate resources accordingly.

### Customization
- Cost budgets offer flexibility in customization, allowing you to define budget periods, time zones, and alert preferences.
- You can customize budget configurations to meet the specific needs of your organization.

## Creating Cost Budgets
