# Components of Amazon DynamoDB

Amazon DynamoDB is composed of several key components that work together to provide a fully managed NoSQL database service with high performance, scalability, and reliability. Understanding these components is essential for effectively designing, deploying, and managing DynamoDB tables and applications.

## 1. Tables

- **Primary Storage**: Tables are the primary storage entities in DynamoDB, similar to tables in a relational database. Each table consists of items, which are collections of attributes that represent individual data records.
- **Schema-less**: DynamoDB tables are schema-less, meaning that each item within a table can have a different set of attributes, and attribute names and types can vary across items.
- **Partition Key and Sort Key**: Each table must have a primary key, which can either be a single attribute (partition key) or a combination of two attributes (partition key and sort key). The primary key is used to uniquely identify items within the table and determine their physical storage location.

## 2. Items

- **Data Records**: Items are individual data records stored within DynamoDB tables. Each item consists of one or more attributes, which are key-value pairs representing the item's data. with max value 400KB.
- **Flexible Attributes**: Items can have a flexible schema, allowing different items within the same table to have different sets of attributes. There are no fixed schemas or predefined attribute types in DynamoDB.

## 3. Attributes

- **Key-Value Pairs**: Attributes are key-value pairs that represent the data within DynamoDB items. Attributes can be scalar values (such as strings, numbers, or binary data) or complex data types (such as lists, maps, or sets).
- **Single-Valued and Multi-Valued**: Attributes can be single-valued (containing a single value) or multi-valued (containing multiple values, such as a list or set).

## 4. Primary Keys

- **Unique Identifiers**: Primary keys are used to uniquely identify items within DynamoDB tables. Each table must have a primary key, which can either be a single attribute (partition key) or a combination of two attributes (partition key and sort key).
- **Partition Key**: A partition key is a single attribute that DynamoDB uses to partition data across multiple storage nodes for scalability and performance.
- **Sort Key**: A sort key is a second attribute used in combination with the partition key to organize data within partitions and enable efficient range queries.

## 5. Secondary Indexes

- **Query Flexibility**: Secondary indexes allow you to query data in DynamoDB tables using attributes other than the primary key. They provide additional query flexibility and enable efficient access to data based on different access patterns.
- **Global Secondary Index (GSI)**: A global secondary index is an index with a partition key and an optional sort key that can be different from the table's primary key. GSIs can be created on existing tables to support query patterns that are not efficiently served by the table's primary key.
- **Local Secondary Index (LSI)**: A local secondary index is an index with the same partition key as the table's primary key but a different sort key. LSIs are useful for efficient range queries within a single partition.

## Conclusion

The components of Amazon DynamoDB, including tables, items, attributes, primary keys, and secondary indexes, work together to provide a fully managed NoSQL database service with high performance, scalability, and flexibility. Understanding these components is essential for designing efficient data models and building scalable applications on DynamoDB.

# DynamoDB Read Consistency

Amazon DynamoDB provides two types of read consistency options for accessing data from DynamoDB tables: eventually consistent reads and strongly consistent reads. These options allow you to choose the level of consistency you require for your read operations based on your application's requirements.

## 1. Eventually Consistent Reads

- **Description**: Eventually consistent reads (also known as eventually consistent reads) offer the highest read throughput and lowest latency, but they may not reflect the latest data changes made to a table. Eventually consistent reads provide consistency across all copies of data within a region within a second, making them suitable for applications where the most recent data is not critical.
- **Consistency**: Eventually consistent reads may return data that is inconsistent or stale, as they read data from one of the replicas in the DynamoDB global table. The data may reflect changes that have not been replicated across all replicas yet.
- **Usage**: Eventually consistent reads are suitable for read-heavy workloads, where low-latency access to data and high read throughput are more important than ensuring the most up-to-date data.

## 2. Strongly Consistent Reads

- **Description**: Strongly consistent reads (also known as strong reads) offer read-after-write consistency, ensuring that read operations always return the most up-to-date data. Strongly consistent reads are slower and have higher latency compared to eventually consistent reads, but they provide the highest level of data consistency.
- **Consistency**: Strongly consistent reads guarantee that read operations reflect all prior write operations that were successful at the time of the read, making them suitable for applications that require the most up-to-date and consistent data.
- **Usage**: Strongly consistent reads are suitable for applications where data consistency is critical, such as financial applications, real-time analytics, and systems that require accurate reporting and auditing.

## Conclusion

DynamoDB provides two types of read consistency options: eventually consistent reads and strongly consistent reads, allowing you to choose the level of consistency that best fits your application's requirements. Eventually consistent reads offer higher throughput and lower latency but may return stale data, while strongly consistent reads provide read-after-write consistency but have higher latency. Understanding these read consistency options is essential for designing DynamoDB applications that meet your consistency and performance requirements.

For detailed information on DynamoDB read consistency and best practices, refer to the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.ReadConsistency.html).


# Amazon DynamoDB Read and Write Capacity Units (RCUs and WCUs)

Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that offers provisioned throughput capacity to handle read and write operations on tables. Provisioned throughput capacity in DynamoDB is measured in Read Capacity Units (RCUs) for read operations and Write Capacity Units (WCUs) for write operations.

## 1. Read Capacity Units (RCUs)

- **Description**: Read Capacity Units (RCUs) represent the read throughput capacity of a DynamoDB table and are used to measure the number of strongly consistent reads per second or the number of eventually consistent reads per second that a table can support.
- **Consistency**: RCUs are used to provision read capacity for strongly consistent reads or eventually consistent reads. One RCU represents one strongly consistent read per second, or two eventually consistent reads per second for items up to 4KB in size. Read per second = RCU / Celling of(itemSize/4KB)
- **Usage**: Provisioning RCUs allows you to specify the maximum number of reads per second that your DynamoDB table can handle, ensuring that your application can meet the required read throughput demands.

## 2. Write Capacity Units (WCUs)

- **Description**: Write Capacity Units (WCUs) represent the write throughput capacity of a DynamoDB table and are used to measure the number of writes per second that a table can support.
- **Consistency**: WCUs are used to provision write capacity for write operations to the table. One WCU represents one write per second for items up to 1KB in size. Write per second = WCU / Celling of(itemSize/4KB)
- **Usage**: Provisioning WCUs allows you to specify the maximum number of writes per second that your DynamoDB table can handle, ensuring that your application can meet the required write throughput demands.

## Scaling Capacity

- **Auto Scaling**: DynamoDB offers Auto Scaling, a feature that automatically adjusts provisioned capacity for tables in response to changes in traffic patterns. Auto Scaling allows you to define scaling policies based on metrics such as consumed capacity or request latency, ensuring that your tables can scale up or down dynamically to handle varying workloads.

## Conclusion

Amazon DynamoDB uses Read Capacity Units (RCUs) and Write Capacity Units (WCUs) to provision read and write throughput capacity for tables, allowing you to specify the maximum number of reads and writes per second that your tables can handle. Understanding RCUs and WCUs is essential for optimizing the performance and cost-effectiveness of your DynamoDB tables and ensuring that your applications can meet their throughput requirements.
