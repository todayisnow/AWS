## Key Concepts:
1. **Buckets:** A bucket is a container for objects stored in Amazon S3. You can create multiple buckets to organize and manage your data.
2. **Objects:** Objects are the fundamental entities stored in Amazon S3. An object can be any file or data, along with metadata, stored as a key-value pair.
3. **Regions:** Amazon S3 is globally distributed across multiple geographical regions. You can choose the region where you want to create your buckets to optimize latency and compliance requirements.
4. **Storage Classes:** Amazon S3 offers different storage classes, including Standard, Standard-IA (Infrequent Access), One Zone-IA, Intelligent-Tiering, Glacier, and Glacier Deep Archive, each designed for specific use cases based on data access frequency and durability requirements.
5. **Lifecycle Policies:** You can define lifecycle policies to automatically transition objects between different storage classes or delete them after a specified period.

## Features:
- **Durability and Availability:** Amazon S3 is designed to provide 99.999999999% (11 nines) durability and 99.99% availability for your data.
- **Scalability:** S3 can scale to accommodate any amount of data, from a few gigabytes to petabytes or more, without any upfront provisioning.
- **Security:** S3 offers various security features, including encryption at rest and in transit, access control via IAM policies and bucket policies, and integration with AWS Key Management Service (KMS) for managing encryption keys.
- **Versioning:** You can enable versioning on your S3 buckets to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in the bucket. and it will be enabled if you allow object lock and also in cross-region or same region replication.
- **Cross-Region Replication:** You can replicate objects across different AWS regions for disaster recovery, compliance, and low-latency access.
- **Event Notifications:** S3 supports event notifications that can trigger AWS Lambda functions, SNS topics, or SQS queues in response to object creation, deletion, or restore events.

# Security and Permissions on an Amazon S3 Bucket

Amazon S3 provides several mechanisms to control access to your buckets and objects, ensuring that only authorized users or applications can interact with your data. Here are some key aspects of security and permissions in Amazon S3:

![polices](./images/s3pol.png)

## Bucket Policies:
- **Bucket-Level Access Control:** You can define bucket policies to control access to the entire bucket based on various conditions, including IP address, VPC endpoint, AWS account, or IAM identity.
- **JSON-based Policies:** Bucket policies are JSON documents that specify who can access the bucket and what actions they can perform. Policies can be attached to individual buckets to define granular access controls.
- **Cross-Account Access:** Bucket policies can grant access to resources in other AWS accounts, enabling cross-account sharing of objects.
- **Evaluation:** Bucket policies are evaluated before any other access control mechanisms, such as IAM policies or ACLs. They provide a centralized way to manage access control for all objects within the bucket.
- **Example:**
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Id": "ExamplePolicy01",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "ExampleStatement01",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Dave"
            },
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:GetBucketLocation",
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::awsexamplebucket1/*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::awsexamplebucket1"
            ]
        }
    ]
}

//cli

aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket my-example-bucket --policy file://policy.json
```

## Access Control Lists (ACLs):
- **Object-Level Access Control:** ACLs are another way to control access to individual objects within a bucket. ACLs can grant read, write, and delete permissions to specific AWS accounts or predefined groups.
- **Fine-Grained Control:** ACLs allow you to specify permissions for individual AWS accounts, predefined groups (e.g., authenticated users, all users), or specific email addresses.

## Object ACL and Bucket ACL
| Feature          | Object ACL                               | Bucket ACL                               |
|------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Scope**        | Applies to individual objects in a bucket | Applies to the entire bucket             |
| **Granularity**  | Fine-grained control over individual objects | Broad control over all objects in the bucket |
| **Permissions**  | Can grant specific permissions to individual objects | Can grant permissions to all objects in the bucket |
| **Usage**        | Used to control access to individual objects and override bucket-level permissions | Used to set default permissions for all objects in the bucket |
| **Examples**     | Restrict access to sensitive objects by specifying specific permissions | Set default permissions for public or private access to all objects in the bucket |



## IAM Policies:
- **User-Level Access Control:** IAM (Identity and Access Management) policies are used to manage access permissions for IAM users and roles. IAM policies can grant access to specific S3 buckets and objects based on various conditions and actions.
- **Granular Permissions:** IAM policies support granular permissions, allowing you to specify which API actions (e.g., s3:GetObject, s3:PutObject) are allowed or denied for specific resources.
- **Temporary Access:** IAM roles can be used to grant temporary access to S3 resources for applications running on EC2 instances, Lambda functions, or other AWS services.

## Pre-Signed URLs:
- **Temporary Access Links:** Pre-signed URLs allow you to generate temporary URLs that grant access to specific objects in your bucket for a limited time period. Pre-signed URLs are often used for providing temporary access to private objects without requiring AWS credentials.

## Default Encryption:
- **Data Encryption:** Amazon S3 offers default encryption options to encrypt data at rest to protect against unauthorized access. You can enable default encryption for a bucket to automatically encrypt all objects stored in the bucket using server-side encryption (SSE) with Amazon S3-managed keys (SSE-S3) or customer-managed keys (SSE-C).

## Access Logging:
- **Audit Trail:** Amazon S3 provides access logging features that allow you to track requests made to your bucket and objects. Access logs capture details such as the requester's IP address, HTTP method, and response status, providing visibility into access patterns and potential security threats.

## Block Public Access:
- **Restrict Public Access:** Amazon S3 offers settings to block public access to your buckets and objects by default. You can enable block public access settings at the account level or individual bucket level to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive data to the public internet.

These storage classes provide flexibility in managing data based on access patterns, performance requirements, and cost considerations, allowing you to optimize storage costs while meeting your specific needs.


# Amazon S3 Lifecycle Policies

Amazon S3 lifecycle policies allow you to define rules to automatically manage the lifecycle of your objects stored in S3 buckets. With lifecycle policies, you can define actions such as transitioning objects to different storage classes, deleting objects after a specified period, or archiving objects to Amazon S3 Glacier or Glacier Deep Archive.

![lifecycle](./images/s3_transitions.png)

## Benefits of S3 Lifecycle Policies:
- **Cost Optimization**: Automatically move objects to less expensive storage classes as they age or delete them when they're no longer needed to optimize storage costs.
- **Data Management**: Simplify data management by automatically managing the lifecycle of objects without manual intervention.
- **Compliance and Retention**: Ensure compliance with regulatory requirements by automatically archiving or deleting objects based on retention policies.

## Components of S3 Lifecycle Policies:
- **Rules**: Define rules to specify the conditions and actions for managing the lifecycle of objects.
- **Transitions**: Specify when to transition objects to a different storage class based on their age or other criteria.
- **Expiration**: Define expiration actions to automatically delete objects after a specified period.

![image](https://github.com/todayisnow/AWS/assets/22843851/7fd6d715-ce09-4b6e-bc2b-aeea1df1ee89)


## Example Lifecycle Policy:
```json
{
    "Rules": [
        {
            "ID": "MoveToGlacier",
            "Status": "Enabled",
            "Filter": {
                "Prefix": "logs/"
            },
            "Transitions": [
                {
                    "Days": 30,
                    "StorageClass": "GLACIER"
                },
                {
                    "Days": 365,
                    "StorageClass": "DEEP_ARCHIVE"
                }
            ],
            "Expiration": {
                "Days": 3650
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
## In this example:
- The rule with the ID "MoveToGlacier" is enabled and applies to objects with the prefix "logs/".
- Objects matching the filter are transitioned to the GLACIER storage class after 30 days and to the DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class after 365 days.
- Objects are automatically deleted after 3650 days (10 years)

## Notes:
- You can define multiple rules in a lifecycle policy to apply different lifecycle actions to different sets of objects.
- Lifecycle policies can be applied at the bucket level and are automatically applied to all objects within the bucket that match the rule criteria.

   - With SSE-C, users must manage their encryption keys securely and ensure they are available for decryption when accessing objects.
   - SSE-C provides flexibility for users who want to manage their encryption keys outside of AWS, such as using on-premises key management solutions.

## Bucket Default Encryption (SSE-S3 / SSE-KMS)
This is a bucket level configuration. When enabled, all new object uploads without encryption information will be encrypted using the default encryption. If the request includes encryption information, the default encryption is not used. Existing unencrypted data in the bucket before enabling this feature will need to be
encrypted by Copy or S3 Batch operation.



## Benefits of Server-Side Encryption in S3:
- **Data Protection:** Server-side encryption helps protect sensitive data stored in S3 buckets by encrypting it at rest, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
- **Compliance:** Server-side encryption can help organizations meet compliance requirements for data protection and privacy regulations.
- **Ease of Use:** With server-side encryption, encryption and decryption are handled transparently by S3, requiring no changes to applications or workflows accessing S3 objects.

## Best Practices:
1. **Enable Server-Side Encryption by Default:** Configure S3 buckets to enable server-side encryption by default to ensure that all objects uploaded to the bucket are encrypted.
2. **Choose Encryption Type Based on Requirements:** Select the appropriate server-side encryption option (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, or SSE-C) based on security, compliance, and management requirements.
3. **Manage Encryption Keys Securely:** If using SSE-KMS or SSE-C, securely manage encryption keys and implement best practices for key management to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
