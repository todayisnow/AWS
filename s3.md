# Security and Permissions on an Amazon S3 Bucket

Amazon S3 provides several mechanisms to control access to your buckets and objects, ensuring that only authorized users or applications can interact with your data. Here are some key aspects of security and permissions in Amazon S3:

![polices](./images/s3pol.png)

## Bucket Policies:
- **Bucket-Level Access Control:** You can define bucket policies to control access to the entire bucket based on various conditions, including IP address, VPC endpoint, AWS account, or IAM identity.
- **JSON-based Policies:** Bucket policies are JSON documents that specify who can access the bucket and what actions they can perform. Policies can be attached to individual buckets to define granular access controls.
- **Cross-Account Access:** Bucket policies can grant access to resources in other AWS accounts, enabling cross-account sharing of objects.
- **Evaluation:** Bucket policies are evaluated before any other access control mechanisms, such as IAM policies or ACLs. They provide a centralized way to manage access control for all objects within the bucket.
- **Example:**
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Id": "ExamplePolicy01",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "ExampleStatement01",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Dave"
            },
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:GetBucketLocation",
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::awsexamplebucket1/*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::awsexamplebucket1"
            ]
        }
    ]
}

//cli

aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket my-example-bucket --policy file://policy.json
```

## Access Control Lists (ACLs):
- **Object-Level Access Control:** ACLs are another way to control access to individual objects within a bucket. ACLs can grant read, write, and delete permissions to specific AWS accounts or predefined groups.
- **Fine-Grained Control:** ACLs allow you to specify permissions for individual AWS accounts, predefined groups (e.g., authenticated users, all users), or specific email addresses.

## IAM Policies:
- **User-Level Access Control:** IAM (Identity and Access Management) policies are used to manage access permissions for IAM users and roles. IAM policies can grant access to specific S3 buckets and objects based on various conditions and actions.
- **Granular Permissions:** IAM policies support granular permissions, allowing you to specify which API actions (e.g., s3:GetObject, s3:PutObject) are allowed or denied for specific resources.
- **Temporary Access:** IAM roles can be used to grant temporary access to S3 resources for applications running on EC2 instances, Lambda functions, or other AWS services.

## Pre-Signed URLs:
- **Temporary Access Links:** Pre-signed URLs allow you to generate temporary URLs that grant access to specific objects in your bucket for a limited time period. Pre-signed URLs are often used for providing temporary access to private objects without requiring AWS credentials.

## Default Encryption:
- **Data Encryption:** Amazon S3 offers default encryption options to encrypt data at rest to protect against unauthorized access. You can enable default encryption for a bucket to automatically encrypt all objects stored in the bucket using server-side encryption (SSE) with Amazon S3-managed keys (SSE-S3) or customer-managed keys (SSE-C).

## Access Logging:
- **Audit Trail:** Amazon S3 provides access logging features that allow you to track requests made to your bucket and objects. Access logs capture details such as the requester's IP address, HTTP method, and response status, providing visibility into access patterns and potential security threats.

## Block Public Access:
- **Restrict Public Access:** Amazon S3 offers settings to block public access to your buckets and objects by default. You can enable block public access settings at the account level or individual bucket level to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive data to the public internet.

- **Transitions**: Specify when to transition objects to a different storage class based on their age or other criteria.
- **Expiration**: Define expiration actions to automatically delete objects after a specified period.

## Example Lifecycle Policy:
```json
{
    "Rules": [
        {
            "ID": "MoveToGlacier",
            "Status": "Enabled",
            "Filter": {
                "Prefix": "logs/"
            },
            "Transitions": [
                {
                    "Days": 30,
                    "StorageClass": "GLACIER"
                },
                {
                    "Days": 365,
                    "StorageClass": "DEEP_ARCHIVE"
                }
            ],
            "Expiration": {
                "Days": 3650
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
## In this example:
- The rule with the ID "MoveToGlacier" is enabled and applies to objects with the prefix "logs/".
- Objects matching the filter are transitioned to the GLACIER storage class after 30 days and to the DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class after 365 days.
- Objects are automatically deleted after 3650 days (10 years)

## Notes:
- You can define multiple rules in a lifecycle policy to apply different lifecycle actions to different sets of objects.
- Lifecycle policies can be applied at the bucket level and are automatically applied to all objects within the bucket that match the rule criteria.

# S3 Pre-Signed URLs (Query string) Authentication

S3 pre-signed URLs are a feature of Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) that allows you to generate URLs with temporary access permissions to specific objects in your S3 buckets. These URLs grant temporary access to download or upload objects without requiring the requester to have AWS credentials.

## Purpose

### Temporary Access
- S3 pre-signed URLs provide temporary access to specific objects in your S3 buckets without requiring the requester to have AWS credentials.
- These URLs are generated with a limited validity period, after which they expire and access is revoked.

### Secure Sharing
- Pre-signed URLs allow you to securely share access to S3 objects with third parties, such as clients or users, without exposing your AWS credentials.
- You can control the permissions and expiration time of pre-signed URLs to ensure secure access to your S3 objects.

## Use Cases

### Private Content Sharing
- Securely share private content stored in S3 buckets with specific users or clients by generating pre-signed URLs with limited validity periods.

### File Uploads
- Allow users to upload files directly to your S3 buckets without exposing AWS credentials by generating pre-signed URLs for PUT requests.

### Temporary Access Control
- Grant temporary access to specific objects in your S3 buckets for a limited duration, such as sharing files for a specific project or time-limited access to resources.

## Considerations

### Expiration Time
- Set an appropriate expiration time for pre-signed URLs to balance security and usability. Shorter expiration times enhance security but may inconvenience users.

### Permissions
- Ensure that pre-signed URLs have the necessary permissions to perform the desired actions (e.g., read or write access to S3 objects).

### Access Logging
- Monitor and log pre-signed URL usage to track access to your S3 objects and detect any unauthorized access attempts.

### Signed Url Creation
- Create will work even on private buckets and objects by `An IAM user`, `Root account`, `EC2 instance/APP` or `someone with STS token' and that for specific period.

### Example
- To create an S3 pre-signed URL for an object using the command line, you can use the `aws s3 presign` command provided by the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI). Here's the basic syntax:

```bash
aws s3 presign s3://bucket_name/object_key [--expires-in <seconds>] [--profile <profile_name>] [--region <region_name>]
```
- Replace bucket_name with the name of your S3 bucket and object_key with the key of the object for which you want to generate the pre-signed URL. Optionally, you can specify the --expires-in parameter to set the expiration time for the pre-signed URL in seconds.
- After running the command, the pre-signed URL will be displayed in the command line output, which you can then use to access the object for the specified duration.

## Conclusion

S3 pre-signed URLs in Amazon S3 provide a secure and temporary way to grant access to specific objects in your S3 buckets without exposing AWS credentials. By generating pre-signed URLs with limited validity periods and controlled permissions, you can securely share private content, enable file uploads, and grant temporary access to S3 resources for various use cases.

# S3 Requester Pays in Amazon S3

S3 Requester Pays is a feature of Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) that allows bucket owners to configure their buckets so that the requester, rather than the bucket owner, pays for the data transfer and request costs associated with accessing objects in the bucket. This feature is useful when the data stored in the bucket is intended for specific users or applications that should bear the cost of accessing the data.

## Purpose

### Cost Allocation
- S3 Requester Pays allows bucket owners to allocate data transfer and request costs to the requesters who access objects in the bucket. This can be useful in scenarios where the data is shared with specific users or applications, and the bucket owner wants the requesters to bear the associated costs.

### Billing Separation
- By enabling S3 Requester Pays, bucket owners can separate the costs of storing data in the bucket (which are borne by the bucket owner) from the costs of accessing the data (which are borne by the requesters). This can help with cost allocation and billing management.

## Benefits

### Cost Savings
- S3 Requester Pays can result in cost savings for bucket owners, especially in scenarios where the data in the bucket is accessed by multiple requesters who are willing to pay for their access.

### Billing Flexibility
- Requester Pays allows for more flexible billing arrangements, where the cost of accessing data can be passed on to the requesters who benefit from accessing the data, rather than being absorbed by the bucket owner.

## Considerations

### Access Control
- Consider access control measures to ensure that only authorized requesters are able to access objects in the bucket, especially since they will be responsible for paying the associated costs.

### Communication
- Clearly communicate to requesters that they will be responsible for the costs of accessing data in the bucket, as this may impact their decision to access the data.

### Usage Monitoring
- Monitor usage and associated costs to ensure that requesters are being billed accurately and fairly for their access to the data in the bucket.

## Conclusion

S3 Requester Pays in Amazon S3 offers a way for bucket owners to allocate data transfer and request costs to the requesters who access objects in the bucket. By enabling Requester Pays, bucket owners can separate the costs of storing data from the costs of accessing data, resulting in potential cost savings and billing flexibility.
